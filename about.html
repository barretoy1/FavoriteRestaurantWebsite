        The Peruvian inspired restaurant Pio Pio, truly is a small family owned and operated business. We first opened in 1994 in Rego Park, Queens New York, and have since added more locations there are four in Manhattan, three in Queens, one in the Bronx and now Brooklyn. At our Hell's Kitchen, Upper West Side, and Jackson Heights locations, we have expanded the menu beyond our hallmark rotisserie chicken & famous green sauce, rice & beans, avocado salad, plantains, and sangria to include Chinese-Peruvian stir fry, fresh fish, an array of ceviches, and fresh juice pisco cocktails.
        
        We also can host your own private event at our newly built PIO 2 SALON, located in Jackson Heights NY. This location is fully equipped with a private viewing 85" HDTV with built in entertainment accessible accommodations for any event! We also host large corporate events at our PIO 8 Hells Kitchen, located in Manhattan New York.
        
        Also from the owners of PIO PIO. The team behind the Peruvian rotisserie chicken chain also opened...
        Juanita's Cafe, serving Peruvian style sandwiches at 84-15 Northern Blvd., Jackson Heights, New York.
        Amaru Pisco Bar, a pisco-focused bar at 84-13 Northern Blvd., Jackson Heights, New York.
        
        We hope you'll take some time to explore our website, and afterwards as hunger sets in that you'll visit us to experience the taste.</p>

            TIME OUT NEW YORK,
            "The white tablecloths, colorfully chic interior and attentive waitstaff may make you hesitate to eat with your hands. it would be a real shame to miss a single scrap of the excellent rotisserie chicken, so if you are too shy to gnaw a drumstick in public, get your overflowing, affordable platter to go."</p>

        <p> NY Magazine,
            "The excellent Peruvian rotisserie birds ... are marinated for twelve hours in a mixture of cumin, garlic, Peruvian beer, and a few other key ingredients the owners prefer to keep a trade secret. Ponder these mystery spices over a pisco sour and a "matador combo," a whole chicken with a tableful of sides."</p>
